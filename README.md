### Download TensorFlow Object Detection API repository from GitHub
Create a folder directly in C: and name it “tensorflow1”. This working directory will contain the full TensorFlow object detection framework, as well as your training images, training data, trained classifier, configuration files, and everything else needed for the object detection classifier.


#### Download the Faster-RCNN-Inception-V2-COCO model from TensorFlow's model zoo
TensorFlow provides several object detection models (pre-trained classifiers with specific neural network architectures) in its [model zoo](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/research/object_detection/g3doc/detection_model_zoo.md). Some models (such as the SSD-MobileNet model) have an architecture that allows for faster detection but with less accuracy, while some models (such as the Faster-RCNN model) give slower detection but with more accuracy.


You can choose which model to train your objection detection classifier on. If you are planning on using the object detector on a device with low computational power (such as a smart phone or Raspberry Pi), use the SDD-MobileNet model. If you will be running your detector on a decently powered laptop or desktop PC, use one of the RCNN models. 

This will use the Faster-RCNN-Inception-V2 model. [Download the model here.](http://download.tensorflow.org/models/object_detection/faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz) Open the downloaded faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28.tar.gz file with a file archiver such as WinZip or 7-Zip and extract the faster_rcnn_inception_v2_coco_2018_01_28 folder to the C:\tensorflow1\models\research\object_detection folder.
